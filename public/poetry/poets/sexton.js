['The missile to launch a missile',
'was almost a secret.',
'Two male Ph.D.’s were picked',
'and primed to fill it',
'and one hundred',
'carefully counted insects,',
'three almost new snakes,',
'coiled in a cube,',
'exactly fifty fish creatures',
'in tanks, the necessary files,',
'twenty bars of food, ten brief cures,',
'special locks, fourteen white rats,',
'fourteen black rats, a pouch of dirt,',
'were all stuffed aboard before',
'the thing blasted from the desert.',
'And the missile that launched',
'a missile launched out',
'into a marvelous scientific balloon',
'that rolled and bobbed about',
'in the mists of Venus; suddenly',
'sank like a sweet fat grape,',
'oozing past gravity to snuggle',
'down upon the triumphant shape',
'of space. The two men signaled',
'Earth, telling their Continent',
'VENUS IS GREEN. And parades assembled,',
'the loud earth tellers spent',
'all fifteen minutes on it, even',
'shortened their weather forecast.',
'But rival nations, angry and oily,',
'fired up their best atom blast',
'and the last Earth war was done.',
'The place became crater on each side,',
'sank down to its first skull,',
'shedding forests, oceans, dried',
'bones and neons, as it fell through',
'time like a forgotten pitted stone.',
'These two men walked hopefully out',
'onto their hot empty planet',
'with machines, rats, tanks,',
'boxes, insects and the one odd set',
'of three almost new snakes,',
'to make the tests they were meant to do.',
'But on the seventh month the cages',
'grew small, too small to interview,',
'too tight to bear. The rats were gray',
'and heavy things where they ran',
'against wire and the snakes built eggs',
'on eggs and even the fish began',
'to bump in water as they spawned',
'on every side of each other’s swim.',
'And the men grew listless; they opened',
'the pouch of dirt, undid each locked bin',
'and let every creature loose',
'to live on Venus, or anyhow hide',
'under rocks. Bees swarmed the air,',
'letting a warm pollen slide',
'from their wings and onto the grass.',
'The fish flapped to a small pool',
'and the rats untangled their hairs',
'and humped over the vestibule',
'of the cramped balloon. Trees sprang',
'from lichen, the rock became a park,',
'where, even at star-time, things brushed;',
'even in the planet’s new dark',
'crotch, that air snag where snakes',
'coupled and rats rubbed in disrepair,',
'it grew quick and noisy with',
'a kind of wonder in the lonely air.',
'Old and withered, two Ph.D.’s',
'from Earth hobbled slowly back',
'to their empty balloon, crying alone',
'for sense, for the troubling lack',
'of something they ought to do,',
'while countless fish slapped',
'and the waters grew, green came',
'taller and the happy rats sped',
'through integrated forests,',
'barking like dogs at the top',
'of the sky. But the two men,',
'that last morning of death, before',
'the first of light, watched the land',
'of Venus, its sweetless shore,',
'and thought, “This is the end.',
'This is the last of a man like me.”',
'Until they saw, over the mists',
'of Venus, two fish creatures stop',
'on spangled legs and crawl',
'from the belly of the sea.',
'And from the planet park',
'they heard the new fruit drop.',

['Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.',
'I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.   ',
'Then the almost unnameable lust returns.',
'Even then I have nothing against life.',
'I know well the grass blades you mention,   ',
'the furniture you have placed under the sun.',
'But suicides have a special language.',
'Like carpenters they want to know which tools.',
'They never ask why build.',
'Twice I have so simply declared myself,   ',
'have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,   ',
'have taken on his craft, his magic.',
'In this way, heavy and thoughtful,   ',
'warmer than oil or water,',
'I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.',
'I did not think of my body at needle point.',
'Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.   ',
'Suicides have already betrayed the body.',
'Still-born, they don’t always die,',
'but dazzled, they can’t forget a drug so sweet   ',
'that even children would look on and smile.',
'To thrust all that life under your tongue!—',
'that, all by itself, becomes a passion.   ',
'Death’s a sad bone; bruised, you’d say,',
'and yet she waits for me, year after year,   ',
'to so delicately undo an old wound,   ',
'to empty my breath from its bad prison.',
'Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,   ',
'raging at the fruit a pumped-up moon,   ',
'leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,',
'leaving the page of the book carelessly open,',
'something unsaid, the phone off the hook',
'and the love whatever it was, an infection.',

['Concerning your letter in which you ask   ',
'me to call a priest and in which you ask   ',
'me to wear The Cross that you enclose;   ',
'your own cross,',
'your dog-bitten cross,',
'no larger than a thumb,',
'small and wooden, no thorns, this rose—',
'I pray to its shadow,',
'that gray place',
'where it lies on your letter ... deep, deep.',
'I detest my sins and I try to believe',
'in The Cross. I touch its tender hips, its dark jawed face,   ',
'its solid neck, its brown sleep.',
'True. There is',
'a beautiful Jesus.',
'He is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef.',
'How desperately he wanted to pull his arms in!',
'How desperately I touch his vertical and horizontal axes!   ',
'But I can’t. Need is not quite belief.',
'All morning long   ',
'I have worn',
'your cross, hung with package string around my throat.   ',
'It tapped me lightly as a child’s heart might,',
'tapping secondhand, softly waiting to be born.   ',
'Ruth, I cherish the letter you wrote.',
'My friend, my friend, I was born   ',
'doing reference work in sin, and born   ',
'confessing it. This is what poems are:   ',

'they are the tongue’s wrangle,',
"the world's pottage, the rat's star.",
